# Squeak 6 by Example
This is the source repository of the *Squeak 6 by Example* book. This is an attempt to update the original *Squeak by Example* book by Andrew P. Black, St√©phane Ducasse, Oscar Nierstrasz, Damien Pollet, Damien Cassou, and Marcus Denker, to Squeak 6.0 or later. It moves the source away from LaTeX to use GitHub Flavored Markdown, with the intent to make contributing to the book easier. There are no plans at the moment to publish to any other format.

The public web site of the original Squeak by Example book was [here](http://squeakbyexample.org/) but it is now defunct and temporarily redirects to the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/SqueakByExample-english) for the English version.

French, German, and Korean versions also available. See [here](http://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/) for those versions and possibly others.

Every attempt will be made to push updates and improvements to the English version where possible (sorry, that's my native language so any translated versions will have to be handled by others).

To view the actual content of this updated book, please visit the wiki page of this repo.

See S6BE-TODO.txt for the status of tasks not yet completed for S6BE.

## Contributing

To contribute to the book, please:

- clone the **wiki** repository (not this one!)
- publish changes to your copy of the wiki and issue a pull request

To start or help with a new translation project, please:

- email me at stephen1965smith at gmail.com and let me know which language you are interested in translating to and I will create a new repo giving you write access (or add you to an existing one)
- be patient as it will take some time for the initial content to be moved from LaTeX to Markdown in order for translation to begin
