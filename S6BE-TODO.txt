Ongoing: fix broken links as they are encountered in the original book's PDF.

Adopting a 2-Phase approach:

Phase 1: convert existing content to Markdown
Phase 2: update existing content

Chapter 1 will be the exception. We will combine both phases to get an
idea of how much effort will be required to update chapter-by-chapter.

Why convert from LaTeX? To make it easier for people to contribute. TeX is a
fantastic system but requires a huge download and investment in time to learn
how to configure and use the environment. Great for authors wanting to dist-
ribute copies of their book. For this project however, it's overkill. This book
is intended to be viewed initially on GitHub. No plans exist yet to publish to
any other format.

1. Chapter 1 conversion to Markdown and update simultaneously - in progress

2. Add bibliography

3. Review the rest of the content for suggested updates. Pull new information
   from the Pharo project (especially the updated Pharo by Example) that
   applies to Squeak 6.0.
